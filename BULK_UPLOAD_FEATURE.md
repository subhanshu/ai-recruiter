    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Status Monitoring API
```
GET /api/candidates/bulk/status?jobId=string
```
Provides real-time progress updates via Server-Sent Events.

**Response:** SSE stream with job status updates

## Components

### 1. BulkUploadProgress Component
Real-time progress monitoring component with:
- Progress bar
- Success/failure statistics
- Error reporting
- Completion status

### 2. useBulkUpload Hook
React hook for managing bulk upload state:
- Upload initiation
- Progress tracking
- Error handling
- Job management

### 3. Enhanced Bulk Upload Page
Updated bulk upload page with:
- File selection interface
- Progress monitoring
- Error handling
- Integration with job management

## Usage

### 1. From Job Detail Page
1. Navigate to a job detail page
2. Click the "Bulk Upload" button in the candidates tab
3. Select multiple resume files
4. Watch real-time progress
5. Review results and errors

### 2. Direct Access
1. Navigate to `/candidates/bulk?jobId=YOUR_JOB_ID`
2. Select upload method (CSV or Resume files)
3. Upload files or paste CSV data
4. Monitor progress in real-time

## File Support

### Supported File Types
- **PDF**: `.pdf` (application/pdf)
- **Word Documents**: `.doc`, `.docx` (application/msword, application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document)
- **Text Files**: `.txt` (text/plain)

### File Size Limits
- Maximum file size: 10MB per file
- No limit on number of files (within reasonable bounds)

## Error Handling

### File-Level Errors
- Invalid file type
- File too large
- Corrupted file
- Parsing errors

### System-Level Errors
- Database connection issues
- AI service failures
- Network timeouts
- Authentication errors

### User Feedback
- Real-time error reporting
- Detailed error messages
- Retry suggestions
- Progress indicators

## Performance Considerations

### Background Processing
- Files are processed asynchronously
- Progress updates every second
- Non-blocking UI operations
- Automatic cleanup on completion

### Rate Limiting
- 1-second delay between file processing
- 500ms delay between candidate creation
- Prevents system overload

### Memory Management
- Files are processed one at a time
- Temporary data cleanup
- Efficient error handling

## Security

### File Validation
- MIME type checking
- File extension validation
- Size limits enforced
- Malicious file detection

### Data Protection
- Secure file storage
- Encrypted data transmission
- User authentication required
- Audit logging

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Run the test script: `node test-bulk-upload.js`
2. Test with various file types
3. Test error scenarios
4. Verify progress monitoring

### Test Scenarios
- Valid file uploads
- Invalid file types
- Large files
- Network interruptions
- Database errors

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple jobs simultaneously
2. **Resume Templates**: Support for different resume formats
3. **Duplicate Detection**: Identify duplicate candidates
4. **Advanced Parsing**: Extract more detailed information
5. **Export Results**: Download processing results

### Performance Improvements
1. **Parallel Processing**: Process multiple files simultaneously
2. **Caching**: Cache parsed results
3. **Queue Management**: Redis-based job queue
4. **CDN Integration**: Faster file uploads

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Files not uploading**
   - Check file type and size
   - Verify network connection
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Progress not updating**
   - Refresh the page
   - Check SSE connection
   - Verify job ID

3. **Parsing errors**
   - Ensure files contain readable text
   - Check file format
   - Try with different files

### Debug Mode
